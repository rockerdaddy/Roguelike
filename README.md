# Roguelike
Code from the Roguelike libtcod tutorials via r/roguelikedev

Literally following a tutorial, so don't be surprised if the code appears stolen.

Requires python 3, libtcod, and  GUI. Only tested on a Mac since that's what I have.

Written in PyCharm, in part to help enforce PEP8 and to learn more about IDEs pther than vim.

There's only one playable level and no original ideas in this code.
