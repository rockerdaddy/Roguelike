# Roguelike
Code from the Roguelike libtcod tutorials via r/roguelikedev

Literally following a tutorial, so don't be surprised if the code appears stolen.

Requires python 3.6, libtcod, and a GUI. Only tested on a Mac since that's what I wrote it on.

Written in PyCharm, in part to help enforce PEP8 and to learn more about IDEs other than vim.

There's only one playable level and no original ideas in this code.
